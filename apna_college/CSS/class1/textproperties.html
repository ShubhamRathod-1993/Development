    <h2>Fictional character biography</h2><hr>
    <p>Tony Stark inherited his family's business, Stark Industries, after his parents were killed in a car crash.[65] Developing equipment for the U.S. military, he travels to a war zone to conduct a weapons test when he triggers a booby trap. His heart is critically injured by shrapnel, and he is captured by the communist Wong-Chu, who demands that Tony build him a weapon. Tony instead builds a suit of armor that sustains his heart, becoming Iron Man.[15][5] The war zone that Tony visits has been changed multiple times by different writers to correspond with the character's age, which is explained by a "sliding scale of continuity" in which the timing of significant events in the world of Marvel may change. For the first decades of Iron Man's publication history, the conflict is the Vietnam War.[66] This was changed retroactively in the 1990s to an unnamed Southeast Asian country,[67] and a conflict in the fictional country of Siancong was eventually established to justify the inconsistency.[68]</p>
